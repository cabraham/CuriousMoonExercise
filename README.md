<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rob Conery's book "A Curious Moon" is something I've been meaning to go through for a long while.  He's a big fan of PostgreSQL (postgres) and wrote this book as a story-driven introduction to this database technology.  I haven't used PostgreSQL professionally at all... I've heard good things about it, but I don't think I'm going to be blown away by it.  That being said, I want to read through the book and do the exercises.

Here's why:
* Reading is fun.  Science is fun.  Programming is fun.  :smile:
* This book is based on real events and findings by NASA.  The data is real!
* This is as close to a real-world introduction to data-science as you can get.  
* I rarely venture out and actually try different technologies due to time constraints.  This will give me a path to follow and learn something new.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I primarily use my Windows 10 PC to do personal development.  The book emphasizes the use of Mac and bash scripts and scoffs at those who use Windows :smile:.  I don't plan on buying a Mac.  

* Ensure you have Windows Terminal installed
* Ensure you have git-scm installed w/ Git-Bash [Instructions](https://linuxhint.com/add-git-bash-windows-terminal/)
* Install postgres
* Install csvkit [Instructions](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/1_getting_started.html#installing-csvkit)
  * Python 3 is a pre-requisite
  * Git-bash did not understand sudo.  Just use pip install csvkit

### Notes

I'll fill this out as I stumble through making things work on Windows 10 :smile:

* The story instructs us to get familiar w/ the **psql** executable, which is installed with Postgres.  If you followed the default installation, it will be in C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin.  Add this to your PATH environment variable
* The screenshots show execution of commands like **createdb** and **dropdb**.  These didn't work for me... perhaps they're aliased a different way. I had to use **CREATE DATABASE** and **DROP DATABASE**
* To connect to my enceladus database, the command was as follows, where 'postgres' is my username.
```
psql -U postgres -d enceladus
```
* To enable passwordless authentication, modify **pg_hba.conf**.  Change all instances of **scram-sha-256** to **trust**.  
  * THIS IS FOR LOCAL ONLY.  DON'T EVER DO THIS IN PRODUCTION!!!
