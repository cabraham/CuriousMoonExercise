<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rob Conery's book "A Curious Moon" is something I've been meaning to go through for a long while.  He's a big fan of PostgreSQL and wrote this book as a story-driven introduction to this database technology.  I haven't used PostgreSQL professionally at all... I've heard good things about it, but I don't think I'm going to be blown away by it.  That being said, I want to read through the book and do the exercises.

Here's why:
* Reading is fun.  Science is fun.  Programming is fun.  :smile:
* This book is based on real events and findings by NASA.  The data is real!
* This is as close to a real-world introduction to data-science as you can get.  
* I rarely venture out and actually try different technologies due to time constraints.  This will give me a path to follow and learn something new.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I primarily use my Windows 10 PC to do personal development.  The book emphasizes the use of Mac and bash scripts.  I don't plan on buying a Mac, but I can execute a bash-shell using Gitbash, so this will be my attempt at making all of that work!


### Notes

I'll fill this out as I stumble through making things work on Windows 10 :smile:
